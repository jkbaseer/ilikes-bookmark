hi. this is jk baseer. I am working on creating ilikes app which will store as a backup of the pages and the likes which you are hitting "Like" while you are browsing.

Everyday we visit some sites and links. we just "like" if its a good resource. Next time! when you want the resource, you don't need to go for the same routine and waste your time. just browse your back up files and read it.
